1.1 : Introduction

-JS is a object oriented language. Means creating objects
to solve complex problems.
-Creating objects for each entity and defining its parameters
and even define the interaction between the objects for them
to communicate.

1.2 : Object Basics

-Object is a collection of multiple values.

Inline Object creation:
var myObj = {};
-To add properties to an object:
myObj.newProp="value";
-To access the property:
myObj["newProp"]

1.3 : Creating objects

-To create multiple objects which has to be done recursicely,
in the case of creating an object for each employee
in a company, creating a function which takes in the parameters
the details of the employees and assigns it to object variables.

var emp1 = {
  "firstName" = "kiran",
  "lastName" = "raju",
  "age" = "21"
};

function createObject(first,last,age){
  var newObj={};
  newObj.firstName=first;
  newObj.lastName=last;
  newObj.age=age;
  return newObj;
}
var emp2=createObject("raj","raj","23");

1.4 : JavaScript Constructors

-Learn how to write constructor functions and call them
using the new operator.
-By using the new keyword prior to function name, it converts
the function into a constructor which is  basically used to
construct objects.
-By the use of constructors, there is no need to initialise
and return the object. Because it only constructs it.
-The object reference is mainitained by the "this" keyword.

function createObject(first,last,age){
  //var this={};
  this.firstName=first;
  this.lastName=last;
  this.age=age;
  //return this;
}
var emp2 = new createObject("raj","raj","23");

1.5 : Difference between regular functions and constructors

-Regular functions have object initialization and return statements.
-Constructors have this keyword and do both initilize and return as in-built.
-regular functions use camel case for its name.
-Constructors will use word starting with capital to represent it as a constructor.
-Regular functions use normal function call
-Constructors use new keyword before its function name.

+In other OOP, new keyword is used to create instance of a class,
but in JS new is used to create an object.

1.6 : Switching function types and calls

-When regular function is called along with new keyword, it works fine,
but the creation of this object gets wasted.
-When constructors are called without new keyword, then the object properties,
is assigned to a global this object, and the call doesn't return anything.
